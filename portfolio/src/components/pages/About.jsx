        Hi, my name is Rebekka Rustad. I am a front-end developer from Oslo,
        Norway. I am finishing my Higher Professional Degree at Noroff School of
        technology and digital media this year, and I am ready for new
        adventures.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have always been fascinated by problem-solving, and I started with
        simple HTML and CSS all the way back in 2008 by redesigning all my
        friends' blogs.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an adventurous person, I am always up for a new challenge. I am a
        well-organized, independent employee with great attention to detail. I
        love traveling, watching movies, and reading good books.
      </p>
